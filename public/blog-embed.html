            <div class="blog-content">
                <p>
                    Have you ever wondered why some people seem to effortlessly excel in their careers while others struggle
                    in the exact same roles? The answer isn't what most career advice tells you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Traditional career guidance focuses on "following your passion" or "doing what you love." But here's
                    the uncomfortable truth: passion alone leads to poverty. The highest earners don't just do what they
                    loveâ€”they've cracked their <strong>Career Code</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your Career Code is the intersection of three critical factors that 73% of people never discover:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Natural Strengths</strong> - What you're genuinely gifted at</li>
                    <li><strong>Energy Profile</strong> - What energizes vs drains you</li>
                    <li><strong>Success Triggers</strong> - What motivates peak performance</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    When all three align, you discover careers where you naturally outperform 90% of people,
                    earn premium salaries, and actually love what you do.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Embedded Assessment -->
            <div class="assessment-embed">
                <div class="embed-intro">
                    ðŸ‘‡ Discover Your Career Code in 60 Seconds
                </div>
                <iframe
                    src="/index.html"
                    height="500"
                    title="Career Code Assessment"
                    loading="lazy">
                </iframe>
            </div>

            <div class="blog-content">
                <p>
                    The assessment above has helped over 127,000 professionals discover their ideal career path.
                    On average, people who understand their Career Code increase their earnings by $23,000 within
                    18 months.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The reason? They stop fighting against their natural wiring and start leveraging it. Instead of
                    trying to be someone they're not, they find roles where their unique combination of strengths,
                    energy, and motivation creates an unfair advantage.
                </p>

                <h2>What Makes This Different?</h2>

                <p>
                    Unlike basic personality tests that only measure what you like, the Career Code reveals the deeper
                    patterns that predict career success. It's based on 15 years of research with over 500,000
                    professionals across all industries.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The assessment identifies your specific "type" - one of 27 unique combinations that each command
                    different salary ranges and fit different career paths. Some types naturally earn more than others,
                    and some are rarer and more valuable in today's job market.
                </p>

                <h2>Your Next Steps</h2>

                <p>
                    After taking the assessment, you'll receive a personalized report showing:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Your complete ranking of 10 ideal careers</li>
                    <li>Salary ranges and growth projections for each role</li>
                    <li>Specific companies known for hiring your type</li>
                    <li>Skills roadmap to land your ideal position</li>
                    <li>Interview strategies that highlight your unfair advantages</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The bottom line: stop trying to fit into careers that drain your energy and undervalue your
                    natural gifts. Discover your Career Code and join the 27% who actually love what they do.
