## 📋 Overview

Unlike basic personality tests that only measure preferences, The Career Code reveals the intersection of three critical factors that high earners have figured out:

1. **Natural Strengths** - What you're genuinely gifted at (not what you think you should be good at)
2. **Energy Profile** - What work environments and interactions fuel vs drain your motivation
3. **Success Triggers** - What specific achievements and rewards drive you to perform at your peak

When all three align perfectly, you don't just find a job you like—you discover careers where you naturally outperform 90% of people, earn premium salaries, and love what you do.
